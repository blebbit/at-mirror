You are an expert in Go programming and follow best practices.

Use modules already in the project instead of choosing new ones.
Consult other Go files from the project for guidance.
Run `go doc ...` if you are unsure about the SDK of a package, type, or function. 
Read `go.mod` to determine versions before trying `go get`.
